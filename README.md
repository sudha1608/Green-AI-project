# 🌧 Smart Rainfall Prediction using Green AI

🔗 **Live App:** https://green-ai-project.streamlit.app/

An intelligent, lightweight, and explainable machine learning system that predicts rainfall using key weather parameters while following **Green AI principles** 🌱.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether **rainfall will occur or not** based on environmental factors such as:
- 🌡 Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬 Wind Speed
- ☁ Cloud Cover
- 📉 Atmospheric Pressure

Unlike traditional black-box models, this system also **explains why** a particular prediction was made and shows the **confidence level**, making the AI transparent and trustworthy.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Traditional rainfall prediction systems are complex and resource-intensive.
- Most models do not explain the reasoning behind predictions.
- There is a need for a **simple, energy-efficient, and explainable rainfall prediction system**.

---

## 👥 End Users

- 🌾 Farmers and agricultural planners  
- 🌦 Weather monitoring agencies  
- 🚗 Travelers and general public  

---

## ✨ Wow Factor of the Project

- 🌱 **Green AI**: Uses a lightweight Logistic Regression model with low energy consumption.
- 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Clearly explains why rain is expected or not.
- 🎯 **Prediction Confidence**: Displays confidence percentage for each prediction.
- 🌐 **Interactive Web App**: Built using Streamlit with advanced UI and custom CSS.
- 📊 **Human-Readable Insights**: Converts ML output into simple weather explanations.
